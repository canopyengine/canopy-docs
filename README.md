## ⚠️ Work in progress ⚠️
**Canopy** is currently in the **early stages of development**, and the **current version** is still unusable as is.
The main focus of the development so far has been on **setting up the project structure**,
**defining the core architecture**, and **implementing some basic features**. 

The next milestone is to reach its **Maiden Release**,
which will be a **headless version** capable of running the core features in the **terminal**. This will allow developers 
to start experimenting with the engine and provide **feedback** on the core features. 

> ⚠️ We hope to reach this milestone **in the next few weeks**.

#### **Minimum Supported Kotlin Version**: **2.3.10**

> **Canopy** development aims to follow **Kotlin**'s improvements, so the minimum
supported version will usually be the latest **stable** version.
