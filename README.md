## ⚠️ Work in progress ⚠️
**Canopy** is currently in the **early stages of development**, and the **current version** is still unusable as is.
The main focus of the development so far has been on **setting up the project structure**,
**defining the core architecture**, and **implementing some basic features**. 

You can check more about its current state and future milestones in the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

#### **Minimum Supported Kotlin Version**: **2.3.10**

> **Canopy** development aims to follow **Kotlin**'s improvements, so the minimum
supported version will usually be the latest **stable** version.
