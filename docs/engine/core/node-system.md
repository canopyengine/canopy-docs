[//]: # (Every level, character, object, UI, menu, and even text can be described as a Scene. Think of it as a container for a part)

[//]: # (of your game.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Equivalent to:)

[//]: # (* **_Unity and Unreal_**: levels/prefabs)

[//]: # (* **_Godot_**: scenes)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (A scene is made of a number of components is a **tree-hierarchy**, so you can have **children-parent** relations between)

[//]: # (them. These components are called **Nodes**!)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Equivalent to:)

[//]: # (* **_Unity_**: GameObjects with Components)

[//]: # (* **_Unreal_**: Actors/Components hierarchy)

[//]: # (* **_Godot_**: nodes)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Each node has its own purpose, so you can have:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (* **Animation** nodes - for managing and playing animations 🎞️)

[//]: # (* **Physics** nodes - for handling things like collisions, area detections, or even ray-casts 💥)

[//]: # (* **Visual** nodes - for displaying things like sprites)

[//]: # (* **Much more**!)

[//]: # (* Even you can create **custom nodes** if need be!)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (You can then weave them together to create your game, and even reuse them across different scenes!)
