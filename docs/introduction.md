## What is Canopy?
**Canopy** is a **game engine** built in **Kotlin**. It aims to be a **simple**, **lightweight**, and **easy to use**
engine for **2D games**. The main goal of **Canopy** is to provide a **fun** and **enjoyable** experience for developers,
while also being **powerful** enough to create **complex games**. It is designed to be **modular**, allowing developers to use only the features they need, and to easily extend the engine with their own features.
