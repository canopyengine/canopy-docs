## Next Milestones

### **Maiden Release - First Flight** (We're here!)

This will be the first public release of **Canopy**. Its goal is to provide a **headless version** of the engine, 
capable of running the core features in the **terminal**. This will allow us to test the core architecture and features 
of the engine, and to gather important feedback. 

Features to be implemented in this release include:
- **Scene and node management**: the ability to create and manage scenes, and to define them in a declarative way using a node system.
- **Signal system**: the ability to send and receive signals between different parts of the engine, allowing for a decoupled architecture.
- **Metrics system**: the ability to track and log important metrics about the engine's performance and usage, which will be crucial for optimizing the engine and identifying bottlenecks.

- **Text rendering**: the ability to render text in the terminal. Text styles will be supported, allowing for different fonts, sizes, and colors.
- **Keyboard input**: the ability to detect and respond to keyboard input.
- **Audio playback**: the ability to play audio files in the terminal.

There are two main goals for this release:
1. **Test the core architecture and log important metrics**: this release will allow us to test the core architecture of 
the engine, and to gather important feedback about its design and implementation. The metrics system will be crucial for 
identifying bottlenecks and optimizing the engine in future releases.
2. **Release a ready-to-use version of the engine**: this release will provide a ready-to-use version of the engine, 
which can be used to create simple games and demos. This will allow us to gather feedback from developers and to identify 
areas for improvement in future releases.


#### **Tech demo**: A simple text-driven adventure game, showcasing the core features of the engine.
#### **Estimated release date**: **TBA**.
